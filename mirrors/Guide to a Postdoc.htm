 you're reading this, you're either wandering around my website or 
you're approaching a place in your PhD where decisions about the future 
can no longer be procrastinated and you're starting to think about a 
postdoc. <br><br>If you're feeling a little clueless about the process 
or just generally overwhelmed, that's okay! Much of the process of 
transition to a postdoc is opaque to many people and full of "hidden 
curriculum" types of nuances, so it's not your fault. The goal of this 
article is to hopefully provide you with tools to move forward, or at 
least get you thinking so you can develop a strategy of your own</p><h5 class="text-left">The foremost thing to ask yourself is: <em>should I do a postdoc?</em></h5><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;">To
 transition to a postdoc shouldn't be viewed as the default next step to
 getting a PhD. There are plenty of opportunities to explore that aren't
 research-based or academic and they range from communications to policy
 to biotech and more.<br><br>If your answer to this question is <em>maybe</em>,
 then it's worth starting the process as if your answer was yes, because
 it will likely help clarify whether it's the right call for you. Once 
you've checked out a few labs and talked to more people, you might 
realize it's not for you before committing to anything.<br></p><h5 class="text-left"></h5><h5 class="text-left">Other things to consider as you read this article</h5><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;padding-left: 8px;">1) <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong>My words aren't meant to be prescriptive</strong></span>.
 Everyone's PhD experience is unique, and the postdoc is the same way. 
Take all advice with a grain of salt; mine and others'. Take your time 
to reflect on what's important to you - your needs and ambitions.<br>2) 
There are some numbers suggested in this article that might seem high to
 you. I provide a rationale for why I think those numbers are 
appropriate, but if that rationale doesn't fit your case, change up the 
numbers.<br>3) You'll notice at no point do I suggest browsing job ads. 
That's because, although they're useful for finding jobs, they're not 
the only way. This is one of those ‘hidden curriculum’ types of things 
in academia. The reality is, there are tons of labs that do not post job
 advertisements and the way they hire is through prospective postdocs 
cold emailing them. If there are people you want to work with as a 
postdoc, just email them (see below). Definitely check job ads, but 
don't limit yourself to applying to labs based on them having an 
advertised position.<br>4) Other caveats: I'm a neuroscientist based in 
the U.S. The suggestions I make might therefore be more relevant to the 
life sciences and to U.S. based researchers or those seeking positions 
within the U.S.</p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="The-Postdoc-Field" style="font-size: 32px;letter-spacing: 4px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 10px;">I. The Postdoc Field</h2><figure class="figure"></figure><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;">By
 the time they approach their defense, some people have a clear idea of 
the scientific field within which they'd like to do research. Others, 
like me, might have wide-ranging interests or simply more than one 
interest that they've struggled to choose from. Once again, that is 
okay! You don't need to know precisely what your career-long research 
interests are at this stage.<br><br>So, how do you identify the ideas and research direction that interest you? There are multiple ways of doing this:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go to conferences.</span> </strong>Try
 to attend conferences during you final year or two of PhD with the 
intention of being exposed to new ideas and meeting new people. This 
might be your field's regular flagship meeting (for example in 
neuroscience that would be <a href="https://www.sfn.org/">S<em>f</em>N</a>), or smaller, more intimate conferences (e.g. <a href="https://www.grc.org/">GRCs</a> or <a href="https://www.keystonesymposia.org/ks/online">Keystone Symposia</a>).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read papers.</span>&nbsp;You're
 a scholar, an academic, you've been reading papers for several years at
 this point, so why is it a suggestion here? It's to remind you that if 
you've mainly been reading papers within your narrow field, and if you 
feel like you might want to branch out in your postdoc, you should take 
the time to expand the scope of your reading. If you read a paper you 
thought was cool, make a note of the lab.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use your network:</span>&nbsp;Are
 there PIs around you whose opinion you value? Have a chat with them and
 ask for suggestions. They don't even need to be PIs, have conversations
 with students and postdocs around you about scientific ideas. One 
advantage of talking to PIs within a field you're interested in is that 
they might actually have personal relationships with prospective mentors
 you might consider, and they can either make an introduction for you or
 at least provide you with some inside info about that lab's scientific 
vision and working culture. I will make a plug here for <a href="https://ubadahsabbagh.com/people.html">some outstanding humans</a> I know, some of whom are hiring. If you are interested in their work, check out their labs!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The bird app:</span>&nbsp;You
 can actually find useful information on twitter (wild, right?) and 
lovely scientific communities. If you're an outsider to a field but have
 some questions or are interested in seeing some of the discourse by 
those researchers, twitter can be helpful. Many scientists will jump in 
to answer your question even if they don't know you. You'll also see PIs
 announce jobs with some info about projects involved. I have a 
particular affinity for those who post not only what they hope a postdoc
 candidate offers, but also what they have to offer the postdoc in terms
 of mentorship and support. There's of course no quick and structured 
way to enter academic twitter other than to just make an account and 
follow different people until you find the content you want, so this 
bullet point is more helpful if you already happen to be on the website.<br></p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="The-Lab-List" style="margin-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 4px;padding-bottom: 5px;">II. The Lab List</h2><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;">Okay,
 now you have a bunch of ideas and have probably started to get a sense 
of the labs you're interested in. I highly recommend making a 
spreadsheet where you list the labs you're interested in and suggest 
making it <em>at least</em> 15 groups. I actually had 36 on my 
spreadsheet, spanning at least five fields/sub-fields. But I have broad 
interests and so I wanted broad reach, hence the high number.<br><br>What
 gets you on my list? Interest. That's it. That interest can stem from 
their scientific scope, their technical skills, something I heard about 
their culture that appealed to me, I talked to a postdoc by their poster
 at a conference and they seemed really happy with the lab, vibes, 
whatever. If I had a general interest in the lab it made the list.<br><br>The
 reason I suggest having at least ten labs on your list is because the 
goal should be to interview with 3-5 when the time comes. From my list 
of 36, I emailed a shortlisted 5 and interviewed with 3 of them. Having a
 few labs on your starting list that represent a big field shift for you
 is a good thing because maybe you have a chat with the PI in that field
 that is just so exciting that now you all of the sudden see yourself 
doing that work. It happens.<br><br>I made a template spreadsheet which 
you can feel free to modify and use in whatever way works best for you. 
It really doesn't have to be fancy.<br><a class="btn btn-outline-primary text-primary" role="button" data-click-id="postdoc-list" style="max-width: auto;width: auto;margin: 8px;margin-right: 1px;margin-left: 1px;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 9px;padding-right: 9px;padding-left: 9px;" href="https://ubadahsabbagh.com/media/prospective%20postdoc%20labs.xlsx">prospective postdocs list template (.xlsx)</a>
<br><span style="color: gray;font-family:montserrat" id="postdoc-list" class="click-count">469</span> <span style="color: gray; font-size:12px; font-family:montserrat"> downloads (excluding mobile)</span></p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="The-Trimming" style="margin-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 3px;padding-bottom: 5px;">III. The Trimming</h2><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;margin-bottom: 5px;">Now
 you need a way to go from perhaps dozens of prospective labs to a 
handful. I suggest aiming for having 5-8 labs on your shortlist. Let's 
say you email 6 labs; you might only get responses or interest from just
 half of them. Another reason to I think it's beneficial to meet with 
multiple labs even if you aren't super excited about all of them yet is 
that it provides you with a broader perspective on scientific 
approaches/lab cultures/etc. It also gives you more opportunities to 
practice presenting your work and meeting cool researchers that will be 
your colleagues regardless of whether you join their lab.<br><br>To trim your list down, there are going to be <em>a lot</em>
 of considerations, and they will vary depending on your goals and 
lifestyle. However, if you're the kind of person who only cares about 
the science and will go wherever, that's valid and you can probably skip
 this part. <br><br>So, what I'm going to do is list some criteria you 
might want to consider. When defining the criteria for yourself, take 
your time and be thoughtful about it. This is a significant commitment 
after all, and at this stage of your life and career you deserve to work
 in a place that fits your needs and interests as much as possible. I 
split the criteria into two layers of trimming one that you can do with 
just a bunch of googling and the other is one that takes some talking to
 people. I want to emphasize that these are listed in no particular 
order.<br></p><img src="Guide%20to%20a%20Postdoc_files/danny3.jpeg" style="margin-top: 23px;max-width: 70%;" alt="Danny Devito smiling in kitchen making pastries."><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: 5px;"><br><strong>Layer 1: what can be evaluated without needing to reach out to anyone</strong><br></p><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost of living</span>:
 we all know that postdocs are underpaid for their skill level and life 
stage. If cost of living is an important factor for you, it would be 
wise to find out what it's like for postdocs in the city you're 
interested in (can also use tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator">this</a>).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Climate</span>: hate the cold so much that it will make you miserable? Avoid Boston.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Family &amp; friends:</span>&nbsp;if living near friends or family is important to your mental health or overall happiness, consider prioritizing this.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Childcare costs</span>: got tiny humans? I hear they cost a lot to care for, and in some cities that amount can get absurdly expensive.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lab alumni:</span>&nbsp;if
 you know the kind of position you would like to be in after the postdoc
 (industry, R1 position, LAC faculty, etc.) you might want to 
note&nbsp;how many postdocs have successfully reached those positions 
(if any) from the lab. I would be careful with this though, because 
people choose all kinds of career paths and it's not always about the 
lab or mentor. This one is a little challenging to check sometimes 
because some labs don't have lab websites where they keep alumni 
updated. You can find out more by talking to people in the lab or the PI
 later.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diversity</span>&nbsp;(of
 institution or city):&nbsp;this was an important one for me for a 
number of reasons, it might be for you. For example, if you belong to a 
marginalized group and the area is one known for racism for example, how
 would living there impact your mental health and safety.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visa considerations:</span>&nbsp;if
 the postdoc lab is in a place that will require onerous 
immigration-related paperwork that you don't want to go through or can't
 do, might as well take those labs out of consideration. This was 
another one I used to trim my list.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lab funding:</span>&nbsp;if
 the lab doesn't have the funding to support your work, that can cause a
 bunch of issues for you. But it's not always easy to determine the 
funding situation before actually interacting with the PI and lab. 
Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to check places like&nbsp;<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/">RePORTER</a>&nbsp;(this
 will only list public funding from the NIH). Additionally, the lab 
doesn't have to be funded in excess, just appropriately funded.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scientific environment of the department:</span>&nbsp;your
 science doesn't happen in a vacuum, right? You're going to be 
interacting with a lot of people in your department (seminars, journal 
clubs, whatever) and it would be nice to know whether there are 
researchers that fit your interests in the department. This could also 
be useful down the line for&nbsp;potential collaborators, brainstorm 
buddies who enrich your work, or even secondary mentors.&nbsp;<br></p><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Layer
 2: what can be evaluated by talking to people in your network, checking
 twitter, or chatting with trainees in the prospective lab</strong><br></p><p class="text-left" style="font-style: italic;color: var(--secondary);font-size: 12px;">For
 these criteria, it can be useful to talk to professors you know who 
might know some of the PIs on your list or at least know of them. It 
also helps to talk to people currently within the lab you're interested 
(or alumni). I found that it's best to do so if you already have an 
existing relationship with the person, but you can also cold email a 
current or former postdoc and just ask for a 30-minute call to chat 
about their experience. With any of these approaches, just be aware that
 once again, one person's experience won't necessarily be yours, but 
gathering as much information as you can is the best possible way to 
make a decision IMO. Also note that&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);font-weight: bold;"><em>reaching out to alumni is really valuable in cases where the environment is particularly toxic</em></span>&nbsp;because
 it's hard to get that information from current lab members who might 
hesitate to share out of fear of retribution. It's sad to say but it's 
true; so, try to talk to alumni as well.<br></p><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lab culture</span>:
 this was the top criterion for me. More important than the science, 
honestly. I reasoned that I'll be spending most of my time in the lab 
working with my labmates, and if the environment is toxic, I'm not going
 to have fun, and if I'm not having fun, why am I there? You're already 
underpaid and undervalued as a postdoc (more on that later), why subject
 yourself to abuse and toxicity on top of that, right? You can get clues
 about lab culture in different ways before ever even reaching out to 
the PI. Because I prioritized this criterion so much, I didn't email any
 PI who I didn't think could potentially be a good cultural fit.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Training and mentorship philosophy</span>: some PIs explicitly detail this on their websites (examples <a href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/philosophy.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.avasthilab.org/lab-policies-and-tips/">here</a>, <a href="https://tyelab.org/philosophy/">here</a>, and <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/hinton-lab/teaching-philosophy/mentoring-contract/">here</a>),
 but it's still not common practice. One of the things you can glean 
from conversations with alumni or current trainees in the lab is the 
values of the lab you're considering. What are the PI's expectations of 
postdocs? How much creative and intellectual freedom does the postdoc 
have in designing projects or choosing research direction? How available
 is the PI (and does that fit your needs)? Does the PI encourage 
professional development opportunities and training outside of research 
(or at least not get in your way if you were to seek them out? Do 
postdocs have resources to attend conferences and network? When leaving 
the lab, how does the PI support postdocs? Things like that. I also 
recommend explicitly asking these sorts of questions to the PI during 
the interview process when you get there. You might feel like it's 
inappropriate, but it's really not. I asked all of these 
straightforwardly and received straightforward responses that helped me 
make better informed decisions.<br></p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="First-Contact" style="margin-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 4px;padding-bottom: 5px;">IV. First Contact</h2><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;margin-bottom: 5px;">You've
 trimmed your list down to a shortlist, and now it's time to contact the
 PIs on your list. If your current mentor or others in your network have
 a relationship with a PI you're interested in, you might opt for asking
 them to send an introductory email connecting you to the prospective 
PI. In my case, I opted to reach out myself to everyone on my list. Also
 in my case, every PI was someone who's never met me or engaged with my 
work before (to my knowledge). So, it was cold email time. 
Unfortunately, there isn't much guidance out there for how to establish 
contact and what to include in the first email. Some PIs do mention on 
their website how to reach out (i.e., should you include a cover letter,
 CV, names of references, etc.), and if you see that you may choose to 
follow those instructions. Ironically, in my case I didn't check if the 
PIs had guidance on their sites and just sent the cold email, but later 
found out that they had guidelines on their website. So, it might not 
actually matter? Unclear, *shrugs*.<br><br>Below is an example of a cold
 email I sent to a PI I was interested in. I used this same structure 
(while changing content of course) for all five of the PIs I wrote, and 
received responses from all five. With the three of those whom I moved 
forward with, we scheduled informal interviews (chats, really) before 
going further. I know some people have subject line paralysis, so if it 
helps my subject line for this was a simple "<span><strong><em>Inquiry about postdoctoral position</em></strong></span>". This was sent Nov 2020. (click image to enlarge).<br><a data-lightbox="photos" href="https://ubadahsabbagh.com/email_US3-01.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="Guide%20to%20a%20Postdoc_files/email_US4-01.png" alt="Real cold email sent to a prospective postdoc mentor. Email body reads: Hi Dr. [name],  I hope you and your team are doing well. I’m writing to introduce myself and discuss potentially joining your team as a postdoc. I'm currently wrapping up my PhD at Virginia Tech where I work with Mike Fox and study the development and circuitry of the rodent visual system, focusing on the LGN and SC. I plan to defend in May 2021 and aim to move to a new lab as a postdoc during the summer of that year.  One of the main findings of my doctoral research is the discovery of subtype-specific lamination in the vLGN where molecularly distinct GABAergic neurons organize into adjacent layers. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing, I showed that these distinct subtypes cells receive monosynaptic inputs from the retina. This finding was really exciting to me because it suggested a means by which this visual area of the brain organizes incoming non-image-forming information into parallel channels by anatomically segregated layers of distinct subtypes.  This potential ‘logic’ of subtype-specific circuits got me interested in potentially distinct roles for each circuit in behavior. So, of course, I was thrilled to follow the work from your lab, led by [former postdoc], dissecting the circuits underlying [behavior].  A big question that motivates me now is learning how sensory information is encoded in the brain and transformed into behavior. I’m interested in tackling this from the perspective of the visual system using genetic, behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular tools. My interest in your lab comes from an appreciation of the technical breadth and creativity of your work, and the innovative questions you tackle.  I would love to meet with you and discuss your current work and the possibility of opportunities in your lab. I think it could potentially be a great fit! I’m attaching my CV here for your consideration. All the best, Ubadah."></a><br></p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn-outline-primary text-primary" role="button" data-click-id="postdoc-email" style="max-width: auto;width: auto;margin: 8px;margin-right: 1px;margin-left: 1px;margin-bottom: 8px;margin-top: 9px;padding-right: 9px;padding-left: 9px;" href="https://ubadahsabbagh.com/media/postdoc_email.txt">download postdoc inquiry email (.txt)</a>

 never submitted a cover letter when contacting a PI about potentially 
doing a postdoc with them. But I do know some people like to do that, 
and some PIs even expect it. If it helps, the general structure of the 
inquiry email above can double as a cover letter too. Also note that 
your email can totally be shorter than this one, but I would definitely 
avoid going longer.&nbsp;If you don't get a reply to your cold email, 
that's fine; it happens. After 10 business days, send a follow up. You 
can also ask someone you know who is connected to the PI you're trying 
to reach to nudge them to check their inbox. Whatever you do, <strong>don't take a no-response personally</strong>. If the PI is interested, the next step will probably be an informal zoom interview or going straight to an in-person visit.</p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="The-When" style="margin-top: 22px;letter-spacing: 4px;padding-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 0px;padding-bottom: 5px;">V. What When</h2><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;margin-bottom: 5px;">When
 should you start building your postdoc list? When should you begin to 
reach out to people? Do you need to have published X number of first 
author papers before reaching out? What about coauthored papers?&nbsp;<br><br>These
 questions are not unusual and are in fact a common source of stress and
 anxiety for senior graduate students. I honestly believe that there 
isn't a correct timeline for searching for a postdoc lab. There are too 
many variables for there to be one correct way. That said, there are 
things that you can control timeline-wise, so let's talk about it a 
little. I'll use the questions above to frame these points.<br></p><p class="text-left text-sm-left text-md-left text-lg-left text-xl-left" style="padding-left: 1px;padding-right: 15px;font-style: italic;color: var(--secondary);font-size: 12px;">(Note:
 considerations for timeline also include whether or not you will be 
doing virtual interviews or in-person visits. I interviewed in a 
pandemic, so it was all virtual. It sucked because I prefer in-person 
interactions, but it was useful in that it took up way less time that if
 I had to fly to multiple cities)<br></p><p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px;margin-bottom: 5px;text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When should you start building your postdoc list? </span><br>There
 cannot be a time that is too early, but there can be a time that is 
late. Throughout your PhD, take note of papers that blow you away, PIs 
or postdocs you hit it off with at conferences, or questions that you 
came across and thought "I would love to do this next". All of this will
 be useful to you when it comes time to build an actual list. If you 
know a rough date by which you plan to start a postdoc position, I 
recommend starting to build your prospective lab list at least 9 months 
before, preferably one year before. For reference, I was aiming for a 
July start date, and began building postdoc list in September the year 
before.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When should you begin to reach out to people? </span><br>Again,
 depends on whether visits and interviews will be virtual or in-person. I
 recommend reaching out to your shortlist as soon as you have it 
honestly. As long as you articulate your intended start dates, there is 
no such thing as starting the conversation too early. I could be wrong 
here, but I just don't see a downside. Also keep in mind that you may 
have to revise your shortlist if you don't get positive responses from 
the labs you want, so having a cushion of time helps. For reference, I 
was aiming for a July start date, and began reaching out to labs in late
 November the year before.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you need to have published X number of first author papers before reaching out? What about coauthored papers?</span><br>There
 is no rigid rule here. It really is up to the PI you're talking to and 
the status of your manuscript. Some dissertation papers take longer to 
come together than others, some people publish 3 first authors in their 
PhD and some publish one. It's so variable that it just comes down to 
communication. If you don't have a publication yet, but have a paper in 
the pipeline, let the PI know in your email and include it in your CV as
 "in prep". If it's ready to be posted on a preprint server like 
bioRxiv, work with your current mentor on posting it and getting the 
work out there.<br></p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="The-Interview" style="margin-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 19px;padding-bottom: 5px;letter-spacing: 4px;">VI. The Interview</h2><p class="text-left text-sm-left text-md-left text-lg-left text-xl-left" style="font-size: 16px;">The
 header of this section is a little misleading here in that there is no 
single "interview". It's really a process rather than an interview, and 
thoughtful PIs will take all aspects of this process into account when 
considering a candidate. The next step after sending out your emails is 
getting responses from interested PIs wanting to schedule a zoom or 
phone call with you to discuss your interest further (some PIs may even 
go straight to an in-person visit). You can think of this as an informal
 screening interview. It's a chance to introduce yourselves to each 
other and touch on your scientific and career interests to see whether 
there is potential for this being a good fit. If both of you feel good 
about it, the PI will want to schedule a visit.&nbsp;<br><br>When I sent
 out my emails, the covid19 pandemic was at one of its highest peaks and
 vaccines weren't yet available. So all my visits were virtual. If at 
all possible for you, I would try to visit in-person. It's just a more 
informative experience. So what does a visit entail? It really varies 
and there is no standard. That said, it will typically involve you 
giving a talk to either the lab or the department. Then you'll have a 
meeting/interview with the PI, in addition to meetings with lab members.
 Meetings with lab members can be several one-on-ones or a group meeting
 over lunch.<br><br>Ahead of some of my visits, I asked the PI whether 
it was possible to schedule meetings with other faculty in the 
department that his lab interacts with a lot. I asked for this because I
 wanted to get a sense for the scientific community I'd be joining, not 
just the lab. And because it was virtual, my experiences are completely 
limited to zoom meetings. I also asked to meet with postdocs in the 
department to get a sense of how postdocs in that department feel. Are 
they supported? Is there a sense of community?<br></p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><img src="Guide%20to%20a%20Postdoc_files/danny2.jpeg" style="margin-top: 23px;max-width: 70%;margin-bottom: 27px;width: 500px;" alt="Danny Devito laughing in the kitchen with a glass of wine in hand."><h5 class="text-left" id="chats-with-lab">The Visit - chats with the lab</h5><p class="text-left text-sm-left text-md-left text-lg-left text-xl-left" style="font-size: 16px;">Okay, so what should you discuss with current lab members during your visit? I've broken down questions into themes here. <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong>You don't have to ask all of these</strong></span>,
 they're just things for you to think about and choose what to ask. My 
hope is that they serve as a reminder of things you may not have thought
 to ask, or perhaps thought would be inappropriate to ask. Some of these
 may be better to ask if you're having a one-on-one meeting rather than a
 group meeting.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lifestyle</span><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>How is the postdoc salary for you in this city?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>What's a regular commute like?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>What are some things postdocs do around town here when not in the lab?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Where do most postdocs in the department/institution live?

that work?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>What are the core facilities available to you, and how easily are you able to use them?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Do
 you have opportunities to interact and potentially collaborate with

 that everyone's experience will not necessarily be yours, and people 
have varied experiences and reflections depending on how long they've 
been in the lab. Once again, the goal is to gather as much information 
as you can before making a decision for the next 4+ years.</p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h5 class="text-left" id="chats-with-pi">The Visit - chats with the PI</h5><p class="text-left text-sm-left text-md-left text-lg-left text-xl-left" style="font-size: 16px;">It's
 time to talk to the PI. This tends to happen at the end of your visit. 
Some times an offer may even be extended in this meeting, although 
oftentimes the PI will wait until they've heard feedback from other lab 
members on how the rest of your visit had gone before extending an offer
 to you. Think of this as the "tough questions" meeting. They're not 
really tough, but some of them may be intimidating to ask. Just 
remember, you're highly skilled at this stage and will likely be 
underpaid (sigh), so you have every right to ask direct questions and 
advocate for yourself. Just like above, I will list a bunch of questions
 here that you might want to bring up in your conversation. But, let's 
start with what you should be prepared to be asked about too.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions you should be prepared to answer</span><br><span style="color: rgb(136,136,136);font-style: italic;font-size: 13px;">(these may not be asked directly like how I'm wrting them, but be ready to answer the spirit of the question)</span><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Describe
 your scientific findings in your PhD and why it's important to the 
field. Be able to put it in context of what's known and show that you're
 excited about it. Even if it's not directly relevant to the work of the
 lab you're interviewing in. <br>• Why are you interested in our group? 
They will expect you to be able to articulate what put their lab on your
 radar. Hopefully, some version of this answer was already in your 
initial email to the PI, but this is an opportunity to really emphasize 
your background and future interests and how this lab fits within that 
context.<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Do you have a research project in mind? I was asked this in all my interviews. My answer to all was "<em>I
 don't have projects in mind, I have interests. My hope is that I will 
take the time to brainstorm a project and try my hand at different 
things soon after joining</em>." This answer was in line with what I 
wanted to do, it may not work for you. If you have a clear idea of what 
you want to work on, say that. Additionally, you may find that some PIs 
expect you to know exactly what you want to do and even propose a short 
research statement on it. I didn't want that so I avoided it.<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>What
 are your research interests? What questions motivate you? What are you 
passionate about solving? This is important because you're not 
interviewing for a technician or student position. You need to show your
 ability to synthesize ideas, be curious, think critically, and have 
some vision. At this point in your PhD training, you're ready to do 
this.&nbsp;<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>What are your core technical skills? This is about what strengths you bring to the lab.<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>At the end of this postdoc, what do you hope to have achieved? What are your career goals?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>When can you start?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions to ask prospective PI&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(136,136,136);font-style: italic;font-size: 13px;">(you'll

 happens if it looks like my project is reaching a dead-end, at what 
point do we pull the plug? What happens next? What happens to the data 
generated?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>I see the lab publishes a lot of 
papers in journals X, Y, and Z. What is your publishing philosophy. Does
 a project have to reach a certain level of 'impact' for us to start 
preparing a manuscript?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>How are conversations
 surrounding authorship and credit had? This is especially important for
 labs that publish large collaborative projects with long author 
lists.&nbsp;<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>What is your philosophy for when
 a postdoc leaves to start a faculty position? What can I take with me 
(ideas, transgenic lines, newly developed tech, etc.)? Do you still 
write grants and publish on the same topics after I leave?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>How do you think the lab did/is doing during the pandemic?<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>It's
 important to me and my professional goals to be doing [something with 
no direct connection to your research] during my postdoc. This means 
time away from the bench. It won't dominate my time but it is important 
nonetheless. How do you feel about that? I asked this question to 
everyone I interviewed with, and in my case the 'something' was 
DEI&nbsp;service and advocacy. For you, that might be teaching or 
something else.<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>I plan to write at least X 
number of fellowships during my postdoc, because even if the lab doesn't
 need the money and even if I don't get them, it's a skill I would like 
to work on.

 be honest, I asked every single one of these questions to people I 
interviewed with. I asked them because I genuinely cared for the 
answers, but also because they served as a litmus indicator for me - to 
see whether the interviewer respects me enough to engage transparently 
rather than being offended by very fair (even if unusual) questions. I 
guess I&nbsp;just decided that if a PI was offended by any of these 
questions, then I wouldn't really want to work with them anyway. So, we 
all benefit.</p><hr style="max-width: 75%;"><h2 class="text-left" id="Resources" style="margin-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 19px;padding-bottom: 5px;letter-spacing: 1px;">VII.

 general, have in your mind three references - including your current PI
 - ready to go. They don't need to have letters ready (though it's great
 if they do), but you may be asked by your prospective PI for those 
references at any point. It can be right after the cold email, or after 
the visit and before an offer is made. So in general have a mental note 
of who you'd ask to send letters.<br><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Do not 
discourage yourself from applying to a famous lab whose work you admire 
solely out of fear that you're "not good enough". You're often wrong 
about that. Academia (and just life, really) already beats into us that 
we're not good enough, so let's not also be accomplices to doing that to
 ourselves too. Reflect on how far you've come now that you're nearing 
the end of your PhD, and realize how much you're capable of if you were 
in the right environment for your postdoc.<br><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Many of the questions I listed in the <a href="#The-Interview">Interview section</a>&nbsp;of
 this article do not have a right or wrong answer. The goal is for you 
to get all the information you need to make the best informed decision 
possible given <em>your</em> goals and values.<br><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Nothing here is comprehensive, but I did try to write down as many things as I could think of.<br><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Because
 of how long this article is, you might be left with the impression that
 this stage is rather overwhelming. It's not! It was actually pretty 
exciting for me and is for many others. It's full of feelings of 
potential and rich scientific conversations. While this article is long,
 you might find that a lot of this is already intuitive to you.<br><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>This
 article has no information on negotiations for salary, relocation 
costs, benefits, etc. but I strongly encourage you to engage in those 
conversations before accepting an offer.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>When
