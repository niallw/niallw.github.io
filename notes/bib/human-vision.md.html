**Human Visual Perception**
[Back to bibliography index](main.md.html)

- **A review of motion sickness with special reference to simulator sickness [#kennedy1985review]**
    - This paper contains the classic simulator sickness survey.

- **Visual control of locomotion in Parkinson’s disease [#azulay1999visual]**
    - NOTES

- **Perception of Linear Horizontal Self-Motion Induced by Peripheral Vision (Linearvection) Basic Characteristics and Visual-Vestibular Interactions [#berthos1975perception]**
    - When concerned with linearvection, visual input is dominant, but it is not independent of vestibular input. They saw shorted delays in the onset of LV compared to CV in [#brandt1973differential].

- **Differential Effects of Central Versus Peripheral Vision on Egocentric and Exocentric Motion Perception [#brandt1973differential]**
    - Feeling of self motion is almost entirely dependent on peripheral stimulation. Blocking periphery almost never resulted in CV. Blocking central visual field always lead to CV. The amount of retinal area exposed

- **Foreground and background in dynamic spatial orientation [#brandt1975foreground]**
    - NOTES

- **Lateral visual field as related to age and sex [#burg1968lateral]**
    - NOTES

- **Attention-based motion perception [#cavanagh1992attention]**
    - NOTES

- **Human perception thresholds of horizontal motion [#chen1972human]**
    - NOTES

- **How the eye measures reality and virtual reality [#cutting1997how]**
    - Claims there are 9 visual information cues that we use to perceive our environment. Provides a heirarchy of which of these cues are most impactful at which distances from the observer. Claims that there exist 3 distinct "fields" of space from the user: personal space, action space, and vista space. The main claim that I care about here is that IPD is most important in the personal space field (1.5m from the observer).

- **Detection of peripheral stimuli under psychological and physiological stress [#leibowitz1973detection]**
    - NOTES

- **Visual-Vestibular Interaction: Effects on Self-Motion Perception and Postural Control [#dichgans1978visual]**
    - NOTES

- **Circumventing side effects of immersive virtual environments [#dizoi1997circumventing]**
    - NOTES

- **Combating VR Sickness through Subtle Dynamic Field-Of-View Modification [#fernandes2016combating]**
    - Dynamic FOV modification is an effective way to reduce motion sickness in VR. Preferred minimum FOV was 85 degrees. Soft edge FOV-restrictor allows for dynamic FOV without the user noticing.

- **Exploratory experiments on the stimulus conditions for the perception of a visual surface [#gibson1952exploratory]**
    - NOTES

- **Homogeneous Retinal Stimulation and Visual Perception [#gibson1952homogeneous]**
    - NOTES

- **Optical modulation of locomotion and energy expenditure at preferred transition speed [#guerin2008optical]**
    - Studies the effect of optical flow's speed (going in the correct direction) on transitory walking phases (walk to run, run to walk, etc).

- **Vection and simulator sickness [#gettinger1990vection]**
    - Provides evidence supporting that simulator sickness is caused by vection. It seems that displays that produce vection also produce simulator sickness.

- **Illusory Self-motion in Virtual Environments [#hettinger2002illusory]**
    - NOTES

- **Get Well Soon! Human Factors’ Influence on Cybersickness after Redirected Walking Exposure in Virtual Reality [#hildebrandt2018get]**
    - MAny factors contribute to feeligns of sim sickness including: gender, percieved usefulness of the VR application, motivation factors (internal and external), exiting/fun factor of VR application

- **Vertical optokinetic sensations by limited stimulation of the peripheral field of vision [#hulk1983vertical]**
    - Field of view affects vection intensity. Specifically, peripheral stimulation can induce a "lift" sensation in the study they carried out.

- **A Schematic Eye for Virtual Environments [#jones2016schematic]**
    - NOTES

- **Simulator Sickness in Virtual Environments [#kolasinski1995simulator]**
    - NOTES

- **Perception of self-motion from visual flow [#lappe1999perception]**
    - NOTES

- **Effects of Field of View on Presence, Enjoyment, Memory, and Simulator Sickness in a Virtual Environment [#lin2002effects]**
    - NOTES

- **Critical role of foreground stimuli in perceiving visually induced self-motion [#nakamura1999critical]**
    - Relative difference between the foreground and background influence vection. It depends on the directions of foreground and background, as well as their speeds relative to each other.

- **Circular vection as a function of foreground-background relationships [#ohmi1987circular]**
    - NOTES

- **Future challenges for vection research: definitions, functional significance, measures, and neural bases [#palmisano2015future]**
    - NOTES

- **Understanding the roles of vision in the control of human locomotion [#patla1997understanding]**
    - Lit. review of vision and how it controls locomotion. Talks about how visual stimuli dominate over extraretinal stimuli. This review also discusses locomotion in people with damaged visual systems (in section 6).

- **The object and background hypothesis for vection [#seno2009object]**
    - Discussion about objects being inefficient at influencing motion. Supports the theory that background is the heavy influencer of vection, I believe. [revisit]

- **Attentional load inhibits vection [#seno2011attentional]**
    - NOTES

- **Human perception tresholds of horizontal motion [#shioya1993human]**
    - NOTES

- **Direction identification thresholds for second-order motion in central and peripheral vision [#smith1994direction]**
    - NOTES

- **1st- and 2nd-order Motion and Texture Resolution in Central and Peripheral Vision [#solomon19951st]**
    - NOTES

- **What to Expect from Immersive Virtual Environment Exposure: Influences of Gender, Body Mass Index, and Past Experience [#stanney2003what]**
    - NOTES

- **The perception of the visual world [#gibson1950perception]**
    - The bible of perception from the father himself.

- **Vision out of the corner of the eye [#to2011vision]**
    - NOTES

- **Speed change detection in foveal and peripheral vision [#traschutz2012speed]**
    - NOTES

- **Tricking people into feeling like they are moving when they are not paying attention [#trutoiu2008tricking]**
    - NOTES

- **The role of central and peripheral vision in perceiving the direction of self-motion [#warren1992role]**
    - Peripheral dominance hypothesis is not correct. Heading accuracy is higher for central vision than peripheral vision, but not by much. Decreasing the amount of peripheral vision decreases the heading accuracy. Peripheral vision is less sensitive to locally radial flow than central vision, which means heading accuracy is best when the point of heading is in the center of vision, where optical flow is radial rather than lamellar. Central vision accurately extracts radial, rotary, and lamellar flow, but peripheral vison extracts lamellar flow and is less sensitive to radial and rotary flow (this is a direct quote). I didn't really understand the MAR scaling part towards the end.

- **Optic flow is used to control human walking [#warren2001optic]**
    - NOTES

- **Eye Movement, Vection, and Motion Sickness with Foveal and Peripheral Vision [#webb2003eye]**
    - There appears to be no correlation between vection and motion sickness. Vection is influenced by peripheral vision (presence of peripheral stimulation results in more vection), but motion sickness seems to be influenced by either eye movements or foveal stimulation

- **Effects of Stereo Viewing Conditions on Distance Perception in Virtual Environments [#willemsen2008effects]**
    - Tested to see if the limitations of presentation of stereo imagery in VR HMDs was the cause of the common distance compression exhibited by users. 
    Results indicate that the limitations do not affect the motion compression. It also specifically checks IPD influence (fixed vs measured IPD) and finds no difference between the two.

- **The Influence of Rendering Quality on Presence And Task Performance in a Virtual Environment [#zimmons2003influence]**
    - NOTES
