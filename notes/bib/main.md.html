**Annotated Bibliography**

[Back to notes main page](../main.md.html)

My notes for all papers that I've read and found useful.
Some notes are bad and include things like "I didn't understand this paper", which is likely because they were some of the first papers I read during undergrad. If the notes say something like that, it means I need to go back and re-read it at some point.
If a paper is missing notes, that's because I either plan to read it, or I only referenced part of the paper and didn't read all of it.
I also use Mendeley to keep track of papers and take notes. 
This page is useful for quick access to summaries of papers, but my Mendeley notes are more detailed.
You may find this useful, but you would not blindly trust a random person on the internet, right? :)
