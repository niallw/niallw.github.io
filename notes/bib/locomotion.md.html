    - This paper proposes a way of evaluating locomotion interfaces using a standard environment. The environment's parameters can be changed to generate different VEs. Parameters include: task or environment type, path lengths, path complexity (bends, turns, road texture) and indoor environ- ment (maze complexity). They didn't do any user studies or anything. It's simply an idea that they propose. It's nothing special, I think.
