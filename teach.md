I greatly enjoy teaching since it's a combination of some of my favorite things: talking about computer science, introducing people computer science, and learning.
I would like to see more diverse groups of people become active in the computer science community, and I think teaching is an important step towards that.
It's important to me that everyone has an equal opportunity to learn, so I try my best to be welcoming and unassuming about people's prior knowledge.
I learned a lot about teaching from my time as an undergrad at Davidson, and I deeply agree with their approach to teaching.
